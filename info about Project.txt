Data Source : csvFile StoreSales  with Import Mode 
Aim : want to do Linear Rgresrrion on Sales Data  
	to Draw a Line of Data , We have to Find the m , b then calc the Y`
Steps : 
1- upload File 
2- Do Transformations about File 
      2.1- select the columns and change table name (Date,Sales)
      2.2- Craete a new Column that is Sum of Sales group By Date 

3- Create a Table of Date .. using Dax query , Will attach it in another File


4- Apply some Measures and New Columns to Be Ready for Applying Linear Regression 
   
	Y = m * X  + b (Aim is to find the m , b of the equation)
	
	to Find m 
	slope = (nΣ(xy) - ΣxΣy) / (nΣ(x²) - (Σx)²) So , we Have to Calc some Columns and Some Measures ,Will attach it in another File
	New Column : X Y XY XX 
	Measures   : sumofX sumofY  sumofXX sumofXY  N   slope
	
	to Find b 
	intercept= (Σy - mΣx) / n  we have everything , so we will calculate only the measure intercept
	
	Now we have intercept and Slop , so lets Find the Y`   so New Column  Y` = intercept + Slope * [X]
	and Lets Get the Measure of Sum of Y` to Draw the Line 


	Till Now , We ONLY DRAW lINEAR FOR THE DATA WE HAVE , NOT FOR THE HIDDEN DATA IN THE Future SO , Lets Do it  
 if yoou want to increase the X valuse to Get the Y` for the Future , just increase the Data AND Create A new Table to Have it Sales-Forcasting

We can notice the Trend in the Begining of Years , So lets Deseasonalize it , To Deseasonalize it , you have to get the wieght of the Trend Values 

IN Date Table Create a cloumn      	 Is Begining of Year = IF(Dates[Month no.]=1 && Dates[Day]==1 ,1,0) 
THEN IN Sales Table Create same column   Is Begining of Year = RELATED(Dates[Is Begining of Year])
		    Create a Measure     

Weight Begining Of Year = 
VAR val =
CALCULATE(
    AVERAGE(Sales[Amount]) , ALL(Sales) , Sales[Is Begining of Year]=1 
        )
VAR  overall=AVERAGEX(ALL(Sales),Sales[Amount])
RETURN val / overall


	
NOW Calculate the Column of Deseasonlized the Trend of Begining Year 
Deseasonalized Begining Of Year = 
IF(Sales[Is Begining of Year] = 1 , 
Sales[Amount]/[Weight Begining Of Year]
,
Sales[Amount]
) 



Also We Notice the Trend in the WEEK DAYS   
so lets do the same in the Week Days 
IN Sales Table       Create same column   				Week Day = RELATED(Dates[Week day])
		     create MEASURES of Weights of Days      	
Weight Day 1 = 
VAR val = 
CALCULATE(
    AVERAGE(Sales[Deseasonalized Begining Of Year]) , ALL(Sales) , Sales[Week Day]=1 
        )

VAR  overall=AVERAGEX(ALL(Sales),Sales[Deseasonalized Begining Of Year])

RETURN val / overall



		    Create a Column  of Deaseonlized WeekDays       Deseasonalized Week Day = 




NOW LETS CREATE THE THREE COLUMN IN THE SALES-FORCAST TABLE 

Is Begining of Year = RELATED(Dates[Is Begining of Year])


Forcast Begining Year = IF(
 'Sales-Forcasting'[Is Begining of Year] =1 , 'Sales-Forcasting'[Forcast Week Day] * [Weight Begining Of Year]  , 'Sales-Forcasting'[Forcast Week Day] 
)


Forcast Week Day = 

SWITCH (
'Sales-Forcasting'[Week Day] ,
1 , 'Sales-Forcasting'[Forcast] * [Weight Day 1],
2 , 'Sales-Forcasting'[Forcast] * [Weight Day 2],
3 , 'Sales-Forcasting'[Forcast] * [Weight Day 3],
4 , 'Sales-Forcasting'[Forcast] * [Weight Day 4],
5 , 'Sales-Forcasting'[Forcast] * [Weight Day 5],
6 , 'Sales-Forcasting'[Forcast] * [Weight Day 6],
7 , 'Sales-Forcasting'[Forcast] * [Weight Day 7]

)


AND THE Measure of Forcast will be 
SumofForcast = SUM('Sales-Forcasting'[Forcast Begining Year])
